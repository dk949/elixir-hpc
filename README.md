# Elixir HPC exploration

This project explores the use of Elixir in HPC (and my process of
learning Elixir ðŸ™‚)

For now the `nx_stencil.ex` file can be executed with (no timing has been
implemented yet)

```sh
iex -S mix run -e "NxStencil.run"
```

Correctness can be verified by running the `test.py` file (proper testing coming
soon).
